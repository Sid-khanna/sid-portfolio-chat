**PROJECTS**
- **ParSight (capstone)**: As part of our final-year engineering capstone, we developed ParSight, an autonomous drone system designed to assist senior golfers by tracking golf balls in real time and hovering over their final position to provide an enhanced visual reference. The project addresses a growing accessibility issue in recreational sports—specifically age-related vision decline—by offering a real-time robotic solution that enhances visibility without interfering with gameplay.
ParSight follows a Sense–Plan–Act architecture. The sensing module uses a downward-facing RGB camera mounted on a quadrotor drone to continuously capture video at 30 FPS. Frames are processed onboard using an NVIDIA Jetson Nano running ROS2, with real-time detection achieved through HSV colour filtering and OpenCV-based contour detection. The system scores contours by size and circularity, isolating the red golf ball even in noisy environments.
Tracking is handled through Image-Based Visual Servoing (IBVS), where the pixel offset between the detected ball and the center of the image is converted into a physical setpoint using a Proportional-Derivative (PD) controller. These setpoints are published to the drone’s flight controller, which adjusts motor output to maintain lock on the moving ball and ultimately hover over its final resting position.
ParSight was implemented on a Minion Mini H-Quad drone platform equipped with a Jetson Nano and Orange Cube+ flight controller. The system achieved 95% detection accuracy with only 3% false positives, maintained real-time inference at 30 Hz, and responded with a total system latency of ~350 ms. In MVP testing, the drone successfully hovered within 6 cm of the ball’s final location, even during dynamic launch scenarios using an RC car and catapult.
The project met 8 out of 10 key performance benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of lightweight, vision-based autonomy for assistive applications. Future improvements include incorporating higher frame-rate cameras, upgraded compute (e.g., Jetson Orin), and deploying more robust deep learning models like YOLOv11 with TensorRT for enhanced outdoor tracking.

- **AI Story Generator**: As someone who loves writing, and is in the process of self-publishing a novel on Amazon, storytelling has always been a creative outlet for me. At the same time, as an engineering student, I’ve been immersed in building structured, technical systems. This project became the perfect middle ground between both worlds.
The AI Story Generator is a web-based tool that guides users through a multi-step form to define a character’s voice, traits, tone, and genre. It then uses OpenRouter’s LLM API (like DeepSeek or Mistral) to generate a rich, tailored character profile and a unique story blurb. Whether it’s fantasy, sci-fi, or mystery, the tool adapts to user input to produce engaging, genre-specific results.
Built with Flask and styled using Tailwind CSS, the app features a responsive UI, structured prompt logic, and clean dialogue-styled output for immersive storytelling. It’s designed to feel like a co-creator sitting beside you, helping you brainstorm, write, and imagine.
This project not only showcases my technical skills in web development and API integration, but also reflects my belief that engineering and creativity don’t have to be separate paths, they can amplify each other. I plan to expand the platform with visual generation tools and longer-form story building as I continue exploring what storytelling powered by AI can become.

- **ViT + LLM Recipe Generator**: ingrAIdients – Ingredient & Recipe Generation
ingrAIdients is a completed deep learning project focused on reimagining how we interact with food through AI. The system allows users to upload an image of a prepared dish and receive a breakdown of its ingredients, along with a complete generated recipe. Designed to support dietary tracking, allergen awareness, and easier recipe recreation, the project combines visual understanding with natural language generation to deliver a seamless user experience.
To train the model, we used large-scale datasets like Recipe1M+ and the Food Ingredients and Recipe Dataset, which provide millions of food images paired with detailed recipes. To further improve performance and generalization across a variety of cuisines and dish presentations, we also built a custom dataset through web scraping. This included gathering diverse food images and corresponding ingredient lists, ensuring the model could handle underrepresented and culturally distinct meals effectively.
Deep Learning Architecture
We began by experimenting with multiple deep learning architectures to determine the most effective approach for ingredient recognition and recipe generation:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
Initial experiments with CNNs such as ResNet-50 and VGG-16 helped us understand baseline performance for visual feature extraction. These models produced vector embeddings capturing essential image features but had limitations in generalizing across complex dishes.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
For ingredient list modeling, we explored RNNs like GRUs and bi-directional LSTMs. These sequential models allowed for multi-label predictions, helping in early-stage ingredient identification from CNN-extracted features.
Vision Transformers (ViT):
Ultimately, we adopted a Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture as the core of the ingredient detection pipeline. ViT significantly outperformed previous methods in capturing spatial and contextual information from food images, leading to better ingredient predictions across diverse inputs.
Large Language Model (LLM):
After completing the ingredient detection module, I extended the project by integrating a Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM takes the predicted ingredients as input and generates a detailed recipe — including cooking steps, measurements, and optional variations — turning the system into a complete end-to-end food understanding pipeline.
Joint Embedding Space (Planned):
Though not fully implemented, we also explored the concept of creating a joint embedding space between image features and ingredient text to further align vision and language models for improved interpretability.
ingrAIdients demonstrates the power of combining visual transformers with generative language models to create intelligent, intuitive food applications. By blending curated and custom datasets with deep learning innovation, the project highlights the practical impact of AI in everyday domains like health, nutrition, and culinary creativity.

- **Formula 1 Predictor**: As a lifelong Formula 1 fan, having watched the sport since I was 6, I am currently working on a personal project to develop a machine learning algorithm that predicts the outcome of upcoming races. This project blends my love for F1 with my passion for data analysis and machine learning, using a variety of tools and techniques such as Python, pandas, and TensorFlow to analyze large datasets that include key factors like driver performance, team statistics, and track history.
To build a robust predictive model, I’m using Keras Tuner for hyperparameter optimization, which allows me to fine-tune essential parameters such as learning rates, dense layer units, and dropout rates. This ensures the model is optimized for performance and accuracy. Additionally, I'm applying regularization techniques like BatchNormalization and Dropout to prevent overfitting, making the model more generalizable.
I’m also incorporating recency bias using a decay function, which weighs recent race performances more heavily to ensure the model remains relevant to the current season’s trends. This, combined with feature engineering, allows me to refine critical metrics such as average driver position, team performance, and track-specific history, giving the model deeper insights into performance patterns.
To ensure the model trains efficiently, I’m using callbacks like EarlyStopping and ReduceLROnPlateau, which dynamically adjust the training process based on validation loss and prevent overtraining. Additionally, I implemented a custom loss threshold callback that halts training once a desired validation loss is achieved, improving overall efficiency.
Ultimately, my goal is to develop a model that not only predicts race outcomes with a high degree of accuracy but also provides valuable insights into performance trends within Formula 1. This project challenges me with tasks like data normalization, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation, while continuously fueling my passion for both machine learning and the sport I’ve loved since childhood.

- **Blue Sky Solar Racing**: I was the Chief Structural and Manufacturing Engineer for the University of Toronto’s Blue Sky Solar Racing Team, where we designed and raced solar-powered vehicles across a grueling 3,000+ km course through the Australian Outback in the World Solar Challenge. Our mission centered on creating an efficient solar car, while promoting renewable energy and sharing our expertise with fellow students.
As the Chief Structural and Manufacturing Engineer, I led the fabrication team through the design and construction of the car’s core components, with a focus on optimizing performance and efficiency. I was responsible for streamlining manufacturing processes, such as reducing seamlines during the plug-making phase, which resulted in a 17% reduction in material waste and improved overall production speed.
I also oversaw the infusion of carbon fiber and kevlar layups, performing tests to refine the flow rate and ensure the car’s aerodynamic flexibility. My role extended to managing the team’s 3D printing operations, where I optimized print profiles to reduce time by 20% while maintaining quality.
Throughout the project, I worked closely with other sub-teams—electrical, strategy, and solar array—to ensure structural and manufacturing goals aligned with the overall design and performance objectives. These experiences have not only honed my technical expertise but also strengthened my leadership and problem-solving skills, culminating in our successful participation in the World Solar Challenge.

- **RSX Rover Team**: I was a core software and autonomy member of the Robotics for Space Exploration Design Team, participating in competitions such as the Canadian International Rover Challenge (CIRC) and the University Rover Challenge (URC).
During my time on the team, I gained hands-on experience with sensor implementation and control systems using ROS and Python. For CIRC 2022, I was responsible for setting up and programming the lidar and IMU systems on the rover. This involved understanding technical specifications and collaborating with the electrical team to optimize power usage without compromising visibility. The lidar proved vital during the science task, where it provided a detailed topographical map that improved reporting accuracy by 20%. I also ensured the functionality of the rover’s sensors and motors and contributed to the Arduino code for the rover’s arm.
Additionally, I worked on setting up a Ubuntu server on our old base laptop and researched autonomy solutions to advance the rover’s performance in future competitions

- **EWB Curriculum Reform**: During my time with Engineers Without Borders (EWB), I led the Curriculum Change Project, which aimed to incorporate more sustainability into the Engineering Strategies & Practice (ESP) course at the University of Toronto. Initially, the project’s scope was broad, but after taking over as lead, I rescaled the focus to concentrate on making impactful changes within the ESP course.
I recruited new team members, conducted in-depth research by reviewing similar initiatives at other universities, and partnered with the Sustainability Engineering Association to launch a university-wide survey. This survey helped us gather insights from engineering students on how sustainability could be better integrated into the curriculum.
The culmination of our efforts was a comprehensive report, detailing actionable strategies for incorporating sustainability into the course. I also engaged with faculty members to discuss the best approaches for implementing these changes. Though I’ve since stepped down from my leadership role, I continue to contribute as a consultant.
This project significantly enhanced my communication, leadership, and research skills, as well as my ability to work with diverse teams toward a common goal.

**THESIS**
Title: Optimizing 3D Metal Printing Using Machine Learning
My thesis presents a comprehensive framework to improve the reliability and quality of Laser Directed Energy Deposition (LDED)—an advanced metal additive manufacturing process, by integrating high-speed thermal imaging with machine learning-based predictive modeling.
LDED enables the fabrication and repair of complex, high-value metal components but remains susceptible to defects due to the highly dynamic nature of the melt pool. To address this, I designed a high-throughput experimental setup that systematically varied over 360 combinations of laser power, scan speed, and powder feed rate, while capturing real-time melt pool dynamics using a 2000 fps infrared camera. This setup allowed me to analyze both in situ thermal behavior and post-process geometric features, offering a full-spectrum view of deposition quality.
Dynamic features such as melt pool stability, morphology, and sputter density were extracted from the thermal videos, while static characteristics like track height, volume, and surface roughness were derived from 3D surface scans. Among all features, melt pool stability, quantified using the steady-state duration and coefficient of variation, emerged as the most reliable real-time predictor of print quality. Morphology and sputter density, while visually distinct, showed no consistent correlation and were excluded from further modeling.
I then built four regression models to predict key print outcomes, using both dynamic and static features as inputs. These models included:
Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Extra Trees Ensemble, Neural Networks
The models were evaluated on their ability to predict melt track height, melt pool area, melt pool stability, and a hybrid quality score combining stability and surface roughness. The hybrid model, particularly when using neural networks and tree-based methods, achieved the best performance with R² values over 0.84, demonstrating that combining real-time and post-process features significantly improves predictive accuracy.
Key findings include:Scan speed and feed rate were the most influential parameters; laser power had a comparatively minor effect.
The most stable prints occurred at high power and low scan speed combinations.
Dynamic metrics like melt pool stability serve as better early indicators of defects than traditional post-process geometry alone.
This work not only enables a deeper understanding of LDED physics but also lays the foundation for real-time quality control and closed-loop adaptive manufacturing. The integration of high-speed IR sensing and interpretable machine learning paves the way for smarter additive manufacturing systems, reducing trial-and-error and improving efficiency in aerospace, biomedical, and automotive applications.
