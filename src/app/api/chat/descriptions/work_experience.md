## Mold Masters – Automation Intern
**Company:** Mold Masters
**Role:** Automation Intern
**Duration:** May 2023 - Present
**Description:** During my Professional Experience Year (PEY), **Siddharth Khanna** worked as an **Automation Intern** at **Mold Masters**, where **I** ...designed and deployed custom **automation tools** to streamline **CAD model creation processes** and optimize **data workflow management** for the manufacturing team. My primary focus was building solutions that reduced engineering time, improved tool usability, and supported **data-driven decision-making** across departments.

**I** rapidly upskilled in **VB.NET** to develop internal tools that automated repetitive **CAD process workflows**—cutting down the time engineers spent generating models and freeing them to focus on higher-value design tasks. These automations became core to the team’s workflow, improving consistency and reducing manual error. This role significantly enhanced **my programming** and **software development** skills, particularly in **automation**.

**I** emphasized **user-centric design**, regularly collecting feedback from engineers and designers to iterate on features and ensure the tools fit their real-world needs. This not only boosted adoption but also improved team **productivity** and satisfaction, showcasing **my UI/UX design** considerations and **communication** skills.

In parallel, **I** built **SQL-based automation scripts** that extracted key metrics from internal databases and generated **automated reports** for project managers. These real-time dashboards improved visibility into part performance, order progress, and production timelines—helping stakeholders make faster, more informed decisions. This demonstrated **my** proficiency in **database management**, **SQL**, **data extraction**, and **reporting**.

**My** work spanned multiple departments, requiring **cross-functional communication** to align tool features with operational goals. **I** collaborated with manufacturing, design, and management teams to ensure that automation wasn’t just technically sound but strategically impactful, highlighting **my interdepartmental collaboration** and **stakeholder management** abilities.

Due to **my** contributions, **I** was invited to continue part-time after **my** PEY ended—maintaining, refining, and expanding the automation ecosystem **I** helped build. This role sharpened **my** skills in **programming**, **process optimization**, and **interdepartmental collaboration**, while making a tangible impact on engineering efficiency at scale.
